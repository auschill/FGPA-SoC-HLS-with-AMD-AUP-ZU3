Click Next until the "Default Part" page. There are two tabs, Parts, and Boards. Go under the boards tab, if your board is not already listed. Go to Add your board file page on this site.


Click finish.

Now your project is open. To add new sources, go to the "add sources" section under the project manager. Here you can add simulation files, sources files, and constraint file to your project as need.
