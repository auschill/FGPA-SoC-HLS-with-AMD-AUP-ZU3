# Lab5_Modeling Latches and Flip-flops  

## Introduction
Sequential circuits are digital circuits in which the output depends not only on the present input (like
combinatorial circuits) but also on the past sequence of inputs. In effect, these circuits must be able to
remember something about the history of the inputs. Thus, the timing concept is introduced, and the
clock signal provides the timing essence to the sequential circuits. Latches and flip-flops are commonly
used memory devices in sequential circuits.
## Latches
Storage elements can be classified into latches and flip-flops. Latch is a device with precisely two stable
states: high-output and low-output. A latch has a feedback path so that the device can retain information. Therefore, latches are volatile memory devices that can store one bit of data for as long as the
device is powered. As the name suggests, latches are used to "latch onto" information and hold it in place.

An **SR latch** (Set/Reset) is an asynchronous device: it works independently of control signals and relies
only on the state of the S and R inputs. The symbol, the circuit using NOR gates, and the truth table are
shown below. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v1/25.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Though Xilinx FPGAs can implement such a latch using one LUT (Look-Up Table) circuit, the following
Verilog code shows how such a circuit can be modeled using Gate-level and dataflow modeling. 

```verilog
module SR_latch_gate (input R, input S, output Q, output Qbar);
nor (Q, R, Qbar);
nor (Qbar, S, Q);
endmodule

module SR_latch_dataflow (input R, input S, output Q, output Qbar);
assign #2 Q_i = Q;
assign #2 Qbar_i = Qbar;
assign #2 Q = ~ (R | Qbar);
assign #2 Qbar = ~ (S | Q);
endmodule 

```

### Part5-1-1

### Part5-1-2

In some situations, it may be desirable to dictate when the latch can and cannot latch. The **gated SR latch** is a simple extension of the SR latch, which provides an *Enable* line that must be driven high
before data can be latched. Even though a control line is now required, the SR latch is not synchronous
because the inputs can change the output even in the middle of an enable pulse. When the *Enable* input
is low, the outputs from the AND gates must also be low. Thus, the *Q* and bar *Q* outputs remain
latched to the previous data. Only when the *Enable* input is high can the state of the latch change, as
shown in the truth table. When the enable line is asserted, a gated SR latch is identical in operation to an
SR latch. The *Enable* line is sometimes a clock signal but is usually a read or writes strobe. The symbol,
circuit, and truth table of the gates SR latch are shown below.

### Part5-1-3

The **D latch** (D for "data") or **transparent latch** is a simple extension of the gated SR latch that removes
the possibility of invalid input states (metastability). Since the gated SR latch allows us to latch the output
without using the *S* or *R* inputs, we can remove one of the inputs by driving both the Set and Reset inputs
with a complementary driver, i.e. we remove one input and automatically make it the inverse of the
remaining input. The D latch outputs the *D* input whenever the Enable line is high. Otherwise, the output is
whatever the *D* input was when the Enable input was last high. This is why it is also known as a
transparent latch - when Enable is asserted, it is said to be "transparent" - its signals propagate
directly through it as if it isn't there. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v1/36.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

D-latches can be modeled using behavioral modeling, as shown below. 

```verilog
module D_latch_behavior (input D, input Enable, output reg Q, output reg Qbar);
always @ (D or Enable)
 if(Enable)
 begin
 Q <= D;
 Qbar <= ~D;
 end
endmodule 

```

* View the schematic of the synthesized design

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v1/38.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Note that since we do not say what to do when Enable is low, the circuit “remembers” the previous state.
While Enable is high and since the always block is also sensitive to D, Q and Qbar will be updated whenever D changes, giving it a “transparent” behavior. Also note that the non-blocking assignment
operator (<=) is used instead of the blocking (=) operator, which had been used in dataflow modeling. The
distinction between the blocking and non-blocking assignment is covered in Lab 7 (Testbenches for
Sequential Circuits). 

Design a D latch (shown in the figure above) using dataflow modeling.
Synthesize the design and view the schematic of the synthesized design.
Develop a testbench to test (generate input as shown below) and validate
the design. Simulate the design. Assign D input to BTN0 and Enable input
to BTN1. Assign Q to LED0 and Qbar to LED1. Implement the design and
verify the functionality of the hardware.

**lab5_1_3.v**
```verilog
module D_latch_dataflow(
    input wire D, // Data input for the D Latch
    input wire E, // Enable input for the D Latch
    output wire Q, // Output of the D Latch
    output wire Qbar // Complement (inverse) of the output Q
    );
    
    // The Q output assignment. The latch is transparent when E is high, and D is passed through to Q.
    // When E is low, the latch holds its value because of the feedback through Qbar.
    // The logic ensures that Q is the inverse of the input when E is high, considering the current state of Qbar for holding the value.
    assign Q = ~((~D & E) | Qbar);

    // The Qbar output assignment is similar to Q but uses the complement of D.
    // This ensures that Qbar holds the opposite value of Q, creating the necessary feedback loop for the latch functionality.
    // The feedback through Q helps maintain the current state when E is low.
    assign Qbar = ~((D & E) | Q);

## Flip-flops
Flip-flops are clocked circuits whose output may change on an active edge of the clock signal based on
its input. Unlike latches, which are transparent and in which output can change when the gated signal is
asserted upon the input change, flip-flops normally would not change the output upon input change even
when the clock signal is asserted. Flip-flops are widely used in synchronous circuits.

The D flip-flop is a widely used type of flip-flop. It is also known as a *data* or *delay* flip-flop. The D flip-flop
captures the value of the D-input at a definite portion of the clock cycle (such as the rising edge of the
clock). That captured value becomes the Q output. At other times, the output Q does not change. The D
flip-flop can be viewed as a memory cell or a delay line. The active edge in a flip-flop could be rising or
falling. The following figure shows a rising (also called positive) edge-triggered D flip-flop and a falling
(negative edge) triggered D flip-flop. 

The positive edge triggered D flip-flop can be modeled using behavioral modeling as shown below. 

```verilog
module D_ff_behavior (input D, input Clk, output reg Q);
always @ (posedge Clk)
 if(Clk)
 begin
 Q <= D;
 end
endmodule 
```

Note that the ```always``` block is sensitive to the rising edge on the Clk signal. When a change (event) on the
sensitive signal occurs, the statements in the if block will be executed. The ```posedge``` sensitivity enables
the flip-flop behavior. For the falling edge sensitivity, use attribute ```negedge```.

### Part5-2-3
Often, it is necessary to have the synchronous element start with a defined output. In some circuits, it is also desired
and required to force the synchronous element to a known output, ignoring input at the D
input. The D flip-flop discussed above can be modified to have such functionality. Such a D flip-flop is
known as a D flip-flop with synchronous set and reset capabilities if the desired output is obtained on the
active edge of the clock; otherwise, it is viewed as having an asynchronous preset and clear. The models of
each kind are shown below. 

```verilog
module D_ff_with_synch_reset_behavior(input D, input Clk, input reset, output
reg Q);
 always @(posedge Clk)
 if (reset)
 begin
 Q <= 1'b0;
 end else
 begin
 Q <= D;
 end
endmodule

module D_ff_with_asynch_reset_behavior(input D, input Clk, input clear,
output reg Q);
 always @(posedge Clk or posedge clear)
 if (clear)
 begin
 Q <= 1'b0;
 end else
 begin
 Q <= D;
 end
endmodule
```

### Part5-2-4

In FPGA, LUT and FF are located in different configurable logic blocks (CLB) and are connected using routing
resources. During implementation, the tools will use these resources depending on how the circuits
are modeled, the type and amount of resources required, and the speed at which the circuit will be
driven. Often, resources for exchanging information are placed close to each other; however, there
can be a situation when it may not be possible. When related flip-flops, between which the information
gets exchanged, are placed away from each other, the clocks arriving at the source and destination flip-flops may not be simultaneously, creating what is called clock-skew. The clock skew can alter the
behavior of the circuit. In some other cases, certain flip-flops may not need to update their output at
every asserted clock edge. Flip-flops in FPGA have an additional control
signal called Clock Enable (CE) to control the behavior. In ASIC technology, gated clocks are used to control the behavior. A
symbol of the flip-flop with CE is shown below. 


<div align=center><img src="imgs/v1/49.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/></div>

```verilog
module D_ff_with_ce_behavior(input D, input Clk, input ce, output reg Q);
 always @(posedge Clk)
 if (ce)
 Q <= D;
endmodule
module D_ff_with_ce_and_synch_reset_behavior(input D, input Clk, input reset,
input ce, output reg Q);
 always @(posedge Clk)
 if (reset)
 begin
 Q <= 1'b0;
 end else if (ce)
 begin
 Q <= D;
 end
endmodule 
```

Model the D flip-flop with synchronous reset and clock enabled using
behavioral modeling. Develop a testbench to test (generate input as
shown) and validate the design. Simulate the design. 

**lab5_2_4.v**
```verilog
module d_ff_sync_reset_en(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire en,
    input wire d,
    output reg q
);

// Behavioral modeling of the D flip-flop
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
        q <= 0; // Reset the output when rst is high
    end else if (en) begin
        q <= d; // Capture the input when en is high
    end
    // No change to the output when en is low
end

endmodule
```

### Part5-2-5

Another kind of flip-flop, called T or Toggle, is used to implement clock divider circuits in digital circuits.
It can be used to divide the input by 2. If more than one T flip-flop is cascaded, then the clock division can
be 2 powers of the number of flip-flops used. The T flip-flop has a T input (data), a clock input, and
optionally reset and enable control signals. 

```verilog
module clock_divider_behavior(input Clk, output reg Q);
 always @(negedge Clk)
 Q <= ~Q;
endmodule 
```

The T flip-flop can also have a control signal called CE (clock enable), which will allow clock division to
take place only when it is asserted. The following code models the functionality of the T flip-flop that is
sensitive to a falling edge of the clock and has active-low reset and active-high T control signals. 

```verilog
module T_ff_enable_behavior(input Clk, input reset_n, input T, output reg Q);
 always @(negedge Clk)
 if (!reset_n)
 Q <= 1'b0;
 else if (T)
 Q <= ~Q;
endmodule 

```

Model a T flip-flop with synchronous negative-logic reset and clock enable
using the above code. Assign T input to SW0, reset_n to SW1, Clk to
SW15, and output Q to LED0. Verify the design in hardware.



**lab5_2_5.v**
```verilog
module T_ff_enable_behavior(input Clk, input reset_n, input T, output reg Q);
 always @(negedge Clk)
    if (!reset_n)
    Q <= 1'b0;
    else if (T)
    Q <= ~Q;
endmodule

## Conclusion

In this lab, you learned the functionality of various kinds of latches and flip-flops. You modeled and
verified the functionality of these components. Xilinx also provides some basic latches and flip-flops
library components which a designer can instantiate and use instead of writing a model. Writing a model
provides portability across vendors and technologies whereas instantiating library components enables a
quick use of a component without re-inventing the wheel.
